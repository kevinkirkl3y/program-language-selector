# Program Language Selector

#### _JQuery, JavaScript practice for Epicodus, 10.23.2020_

#### by _**Kevin Kirkley**_

## Description

_This page is a practice in the use of JQuery through the application of user input tools, variable creation, branching and other JQuery functions. Specifically this page takes user input which is then asigned specific value and plugged into a branch which then determines the language 'best suited' for the user. In an effort to apply basic logical reasoning the questions were kept simple and relatively unrelated to the actual results provided. Please keep this in mind when acting upon pursuance of the programming languages suggested._
